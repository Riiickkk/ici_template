# Project Title

Talk-To-Cashier

## Project Description

This project is an AI cashier that helps the customers order their beverages at drink shops. We aim to let the AI cashier be capable of interacting with customers by receiving and processing verbal orders through speech recognition technology, accurately calculates the total amount based on the selected items and facilitates the checkout process using integrated payment functions. By replicating the core functions of a human cashier—including listening, calculating, and processing transactions—the AI cashier enhances efficiency, reduces labor demands, and ensures a smooth and consistent customer experience.
